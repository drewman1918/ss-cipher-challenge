## Stack Sports Cipher Challenge

This application was built with React. Simply clone and run npm(yarn) install.

If your message has previously been ciphered with this algorithm, place it in the encrypted box and press decrypt. The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet is already in this section as an example.

If you wish to encrypt a message, simply type your message in the decrypted box, and press encrypt.

The algorithm will keep all original capitalization and punctuation, but cipher each letter.
